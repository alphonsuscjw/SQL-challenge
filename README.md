# SQL-challenge

This challenge analyses the people whom Pewlett Hackard employed during the 1980s and 1990s.


All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.


This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modelling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Data modelling
In this part, an ERD is drawn, showing the relationship between the data in each of the 6 CSV files.

## Data engineering
A table schema for each of the six CSV files is created, with the appropriate data types, primary keys, foreign keys, value length etc. The data from each CSV file is then imported to the correct corresponding table.

## Data analysis
8 queries, as required by this challenge, are done based on the table values, using the JOIN functions, WHERE clauses etc.
